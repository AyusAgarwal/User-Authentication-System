# User-Authentication-System
The technologies that I have used here are Express, Mongodb and nodejs
The main file is index.js where i have defined a path /auth which will redirect to Authrouter there I have four router for signup, login, password reset rquest and reset password.
Now to run this application you can connect your frontend code with this and then run on any port and when frontend and backend combine all the functionality will work smmothly.
/api/signup	POST	User registration
/api/login	POST	User login
